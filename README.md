# Final_Year_Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting cardiovascular diseases (CVD) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, and early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. The project leverages a publicly available dataset from Kaggle to build and compare various models for accurate CVD prediction.

Key Features
- Dataset: The dataset contains 70,000 instances with 12 features, including age, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors like smoking and physical activity.

- Models: The project implements multiple machine learning and deep learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and AlexNet.

- Performance Metrics: Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results
- The highest accuracy achieved was 73.92% using the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model.

= Logistic Regression performed best among traditional machine learning models with an accuracy of 72.0%.

- Detailed performance comparisons for all models are provided in the project report.
